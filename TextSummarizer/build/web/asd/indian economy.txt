 The economy of India is the twelfth largest economy in the world by nominal value[9] and the fourth largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).
 [10] In the 1990s, following economic reform from the socialist-inspired economy of post-independence India, the country began to experience rapid economic growth, as markets opened for international competition and investment.
  In the 21st century, India is an emerging economic power with vast human and natural resources, and a huge knowledge base.
  Economists predict that by 2020,[11] India will be among the leading economies of the world.

 India was under social democratic-based policies from 1947 to 1991.
  The economy was characterised by extensive regulation, protectionism, and public ownership, leading to pervasive corruption and slow growth.
 [12][13][14][15] Since 1991, continuing economic liberalisation has moved the economy towards a market-based system.

  Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, potatoes, cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, poultry and fish.

 Despite robust economic growth, India continues to face many major problems.
  The recent economic development has widened the economic inequality across the country.
 [27] Despite sustained high economic growth rate, approximately 80% of its population lives on less than $2 a day (PPP).
 [28] Even though the arrival of Green Revolution brought end to famines in India,[29] 40% of children under the age of three are underweight and a third of all men and women suffer from chronic energy deficiency.

 The 1872 census revealed that 99.
 3% of the population of the region constituting present-day India resided in villages,[34] whose economies were largely isolated and self-sustaining, with agriculture the predominant occupation.
  This satisfied the food requirements of the village and provided raw materials for hand-based industries, such as textiles, food processing and crafts.
  Although many kingdoms and rulers issued coins, barter was prevalent.
  Villages paid a portion of their agricultural produce as revenue to the rulers, while its craftsmen received a part of the crops at harvest time for their services.

 Religion, especially Hinduism, and the caste and the joint family systems, played an influential role in shaping economic activities.
 [36] The caste system functioned much like medieval European guilds, ensuring the division of labour, providing for the training of apprentices and, in some cases, allowing manufacturers to achieve narrow specialization.
  For instance, in certain regions, producing each variety of cloth was the specialty of a particular sub-caste.

 Textiles such as muslin, Calicos, shawls, and agricultural products such as pepper, cinnamon, opium and indigo were exported to Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia in return for gold and silver.

 [39] India, by the time of the arrival of the British, was a largely traditional agrarian economy with a dominant subsistence sector dependent on primitive technology.
  It existed alongside a competitively developed network of commerce, manufacturing and credit.
  After the decline of the Mughals, western, central and parts of south and north India were integrated and administered by the Maratha Empire.

 Indian economic policy after independence was influenced by the colonial experience (which was seen by Indian leaders as exploitative in nature) and by those.
  Policy tended towards protectionism, with a strong emphasis on import substitution, industrialization, state intervention in labor and financial markets, a large public sector, business regulation, and central planning.
 [48] Five-Year Plans of India resembled central planning in the Soviet Union.
  Steel, mining, machine tools, water, telecommunications, insurance, and electrical plants, among other industries, were effectively nationalized in the mid-1950s.
 [49] Elaborate licences, regulations and the accompanying red tape, commonly referred to as Licence Raj, were required to set up business in India between 1947 and 1990.

 Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister, along with the statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, carried on by Indira Gandhi formulated and oversaw economic policy.
  They expected favorable outcomes from this strategy, because it involved both public and private sectors and was based on direct and indirect state intervention, rather than the more extreme Soviet-style central command system.
 [51][dead link] The policy of concentrating simultaneously on capital- and technology-intensive heavy industry and subsidizing manual, low-skill cottage industries was criticized by economist Milton Friedman, who thought it would waste capital and labour, and retard the development of small manufacturers.
 [52][dead link] The rate from 1947–80 was derisively referred to as the Hindu rate of growth, because of the unfavourable comparison with growth rates in other Asian countries, especially the "East Asian Tigers".

 In response, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao along with his finance minister Manmohan Singh initiated the economic liberalisation of 1991.
  The reforms did away with the Licence Raj (investment, industrial and import licensing) and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of foreign direct investment in many sectors.
 [56] Since then, the overall direction of liberalisation has remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has tried to take on powerful lobbies such as the trade unions and farmers, or contentious issues such as reforming labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies.
 [57] Since 1990 India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the developing world; during this period, the economy has grown constantly, but with a few major setbacks.
  This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates and food security.

 6% of the GDP in 2007, employed 60% of the total workforce[22] and despite a steady decline of its share in the GDP, is still the largest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall socio-economic development of India.
  Yields per unit area of all crops have grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since Green revolution in India.
  However, international comparisons reveal the average yield in India is generally 30% to 50% of the highest average yield in the world.

 Economic reforms brought foreign competition, led to privatisation of certain public sector industries, opened up sectors hitherto reserved for the public sector and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving consumer goods.
 [77] Post-liberalisation, the Indian private sector, which was usually run by oligopolies of old family firms and required political connections to prosper was faced with foreign competition, including the threat of cheaper Chinese imports.
  It has since handled the change by squeezing costs, revamping management, focusing on designing new products and relying on low labour costs and technology.
