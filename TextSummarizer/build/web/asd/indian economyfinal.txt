 The economy of India is the twelfth largest economy in the world by nominal value[9] and the fourth largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).
 [10] In the 1990s, following economic reform from the socialist-inspired economy of post-independence India, the country began to experience rapid economic growth, as markets opened for international competition and investment.
  The economy was characterised by extensive regulation, protectionism, and public ownership, leading to pervasive corruption and slow growth.
 [12][13][14][15] Since 1991, continuing economic liberalisation has moved the economy towards a market-based system.
 [39] India, by the time of the arrival of the British, was a largely traditional agrarian economy with a dominant subsistence sector dependent on primitive technology.
 [57] Since 1990 India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the developing world; during this period, the economy has grown constantly, but with a few major setbacks.
  By 2035, it was projected to be the third largest economy of the world, behind US and China.
