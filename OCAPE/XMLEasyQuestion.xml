    <Answer ID= "6">
      Answer: B, E
      Explanation:
      Indexes are created automatically by Oracle to support integrity constraints that enforce
      uniqueness. The two types of integrity constraints that enforce uniqueness are PRIMARY
      KEY and UNIQUE constraints. When the primary key or UNIQUE constraint is declared, a
      unique index to support the column’s uniqueness is also created, and all values in all columns
      that were defined as part of the primary key or UNIQUE constraint are placed into the index.
