          <FONT COLOR="RED">CREATING A DATABASE</FONT>
        </H1>Before you can store data in a database, you must first define the structure of the data.<br />
        Suppose you want to expand the sample database by adding a table of data about the<br />
        products sold by your company. For each product, the data to be stored includes:&lt;/H3&gt;<br />

        <FONT COLOR="GREEN">
          <B>
            � a three-character manufacturer ID code,<br />
            � a five-character product ID code,<br />
            � a description of up to thirty characters,<br />
            � the price of the product, and<br />
            � the quantity currently on hand.<br />
          </B>
          <br />
        </FONT>
        <H3>
          This SQL CREATE TABLE statement defines a new table to store the products data:<br />
        </H3>
        <FONT COLOR="GREEN">
          <B>
            CREATE TABLE PRODUCTS<br />
            (MFR_ID CHAR(3),<br />

            PRODUCT_ID CHAR(5),<br />
            DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(20),<br />
            PRICE MONEY,<br />
            QTY_ON_HAND INTEGER)<br />
          </B>
          <br />
        </FONT>
        Table created.
        <H3>
          Although more cryptic than the previous SQL statements, the CREATE TABLE statement<br />
          is still fairly straightforward. It assigns the name PRODUCTS to the new table and specifies<br />
          the name and type of data stored in each of its five columns.<br />

          Once the table has been created, you can fill it with data. Here's an INSERT statement<br />
          for a new shipment of 250 size 7 widgets (product ACI-41007), which cost $225.00<br />
          apiece:
        </H3>
        <br />
        <FONT COLOR="GREEN">
          <B>
            QTY_ON_HAND)<br />
            VALUES ('ACI', '41007', 'Size 7 Widget', 225.00, 250)<br />

          </B>
        </FONT><br />
        1 row inserted.
        <H3>
          Finally, if you discover later that you no longer need to store the products data in the<br />

          database, you can erase the table (and all of the data it contains) with the DROP TABLE<br />
          statement:<br />
        </H3>
        <FONT COLOR="GREEN">
          <B>
            DROP TABLE PRODUCTS<br />

          </B>
        </FONT>
        Table dropped.

        some existing within the database, others external to it.
        Anything that can be done
        with OEM can also be done through SQL
        statements. The OCP examinations test
        the use of SQL for administration work
        extensively. It is vital to be familiar with
